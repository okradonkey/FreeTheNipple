A RimWorld mod:

Uncovered torsos no longer cause women to feel naked and embarrassed.

- Should be compatible with any mods.

### Notes
- Should be safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list after Harmony.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just alters the PsychologicallyNude method to evaluate females the same as males.
